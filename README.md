This project implements a simple analogue of a blockchain system that can deal with transactions, accounts and their balances. The main entities of this system are actors who transact cryptoassets, transactions, transaction pools, cryptoassets, blocks and blockchain itself. They can be enumerated as follows:

- Actors:
  - Alice
  - Bob
  - Steave
  - John
  
- Cryptoassets:
   - Ethereum (ETH)
   - Bitcoin (BTC)

- Core architectural elements:
   - Transaction
   - Transaction pool
   - Block
   - Blockchain
